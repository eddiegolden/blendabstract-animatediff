# A workflow to add some cool effect on boring images
ComfyUI workflow with two images blended together (I used a visual of a gamer and an abstract brushstrokes)
The blended image goes through ControlNet-union-SDXL to a Mad Scientist IPadapter and from there to Animatediff and an upscaler
### This workflow needs at least 16GB VRAM to run it fully
### You might need to install some nodes but they are all recommended
### Follow IPadapter and Animatediff tutorials to see which models you need to download
